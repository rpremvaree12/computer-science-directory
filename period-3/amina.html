    <h1>My name is Amina!! I love Tinkerbell. - Amina "I want to be just like Sofia because she is the sweetest.  I just love the way Sofia is as a person and how humble and honest she is. I met Sofia the first day of school, and she's that one person who I'm here with today. She is my cousin, one of my best friends and one of the best people I've met in my life. Sofia loves me very much, maybe even more than how much I love her." - Sofia </h1>
