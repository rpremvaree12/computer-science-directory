    <h1>I'm an elite student in Computer Science in Manhattan Hunter Science high School but I'm bsing(I'm lying) through the class so it's all gucci like sushi. </h1>
    <p2>I never liked Computer Science in the first place. I came into this class thinking that I'll get an easy A and learn how to hack bank accounts and steal identities. But it turns out that I actually have to do a lot of work and it's actually type fun. I also developed a crush on Sebastian Cabrejos as well, and he's ode cute (thirsty emoji) </p2>

    <p3>I like listening to music and watching tv. Basketball is my favorite sport and I just started playing volleyball, which I'm pretty decent at at it as well. I love eating but I'm getting type fat. So I'ma stop eating junk food and start eating healthy. </p3>
