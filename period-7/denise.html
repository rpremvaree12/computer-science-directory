     I woke up yesterday at 6:15 am, juts like i do everyday. And i got ready, ate and went to the cra because my mom drives me tyo the subway station. I get onto the L train and everything was fine until our train stopped between bedford ave and 1st ave which means that we were literally under water in the tunnel stuck.After the "very detailed lasy" told us that there was an invinvestigation in the train in front of us" and TOTALLY calming us down by saying "we will be moving shorty". After about an hour and a half of waiting "pactiently" in a crowded train.It started to move agian but not towards school but back towards brooklyn. SO i ENDED UP GOING HOME.
