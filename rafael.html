 <h1>Hi I'm Rafael Bustamante, I'm 16 years old and born in August 3, 1999. I'm sitting here next to Amal trying to console him for his troubles today. He's been annoyed for all the things that happened in his history class. Ashley is also trying to console Amal but it is to no avail. To be honest, it's actually really funny.
